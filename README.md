# TheDailySynapse

TheDailySynapse is a technical news aggregator that acts as a personal "Staff Engineer" to curate the most significant daily articles from high-volume engineering blogs. It transforms noisy RSS feeds into a focused "Daily 5" briefing, ensuring you only read what truly matters.

## Core Features

*   **Intelligent Curation:** Leverages an LLM-powered "Staff Engineer" persona to analyze, score, and rank articles for technical depth and relevance.
*   **Focused Briefings:** Distills content from numerous sources into a concise list of the top five articles each day.
*   **Semantic Search:** Enables powerful, vector-based search across all ingested articles for deep technical research.
*   **Clean Reading:** Extracts core content from articles, stripping away ads and unnecessary chrome for a focused reading experience.

This project is designed to be a simple, single-user tool with a focus on high-signal content and efficient knowledge discovery.
